# Task-02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

In this task, we will perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends in the data, and gain insights that could help in data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Titanic dataset**, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. This dataset is commonly used for machine learning and data analysis tasks. It includes features like:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger's name
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Handling missing values**: Identify and address missing data using techniques such as filling with the mean, median, or mode, or dropping rows/columns with excessive missing values.
- **Dealing with incorrect data types**: Ensure that categorical variables, such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked', are correctly encoded for analysis.
- **Removing unnecessary columns**: Remove irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., `PassengerId`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`).
  
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Use summary statistics to understand the distribution of the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to understand relationships between variables.
  - Bar charts, histograms, and count plots for categorical data (e.g., survival rate by gender or passenger class).
  - Boxplots and distribution plots for continuous variables (e.g., age and fare distribution).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Compute the correlation matrix to identify linear relationships between numeric features.
- **Handling Outliers**: Detect and manage outliers using techniques like box plots and Z-scores.
  
### 3. Insights and Observations
Based on the analysis, derive insights such as:
- Which factors most strongly correlate with survival?
- How age, fare, and class impacted survival rates.
- Patterns in family size and its relationship to survival.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The programming language used for data cleaning and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn** (optional): For data preprocessing and potentially building predictive models.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```
3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and place it in the project folder.
4. Open the `eda_titanic.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
5. Run each cell sequentially to perform the data cleaning and EDA.

## Future Work
- Perform feature engineering to improve predictions.
- Train machine learning models using cleaned and preprocessed data.
- Further explore relationships between variables using advanced statistical techniques.
